    "text": "1 Introduction\nUnderstanding the efficiency of locations is becoming increasingly important in an era of rapid urbanization and growing interest in sustainable living. The Smart Location Database is a valuable resource for understanding the intricate relationships that exist between transportation systems, urban planning, and demographic trends. This national dataset gathers more than 90 characteristics and provide a comprehensive picture of location efficiency, including employment possibilities, transit service, neighborhood design, land use diversity, housing density, and even demographic trends. Additionally, it offers information at census block groups level, providing an enormous amount of data for scholars, decision-makers, and urban planners.\nIn this study, we focus on Manhattan, New York City because Manhattan offers an exceptional case for analyzing the complex factors influencing location efficiency and urban sustainability.\nThrough this analysis, we want to answer these two questions:\n\nWhat role does land use diversity play in influencing the efficiency of urban areas in Manhattan?\nCan we identify trends in employment possibilities, transit service, land use diversity, and housing density in Manhattan and provide recommendations for urban planning or transportation infrastructure improvements?\n\nBy focusing on Manhattan, we intend to provide insightful information that can promote equitable growth, improve the quality of life for its citizens, and improve equity. Join us as we investigate Manhattan’s story from the Smart Location Database!",

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe SLD dataset (url: https://edg.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/public/OA/EPA_SmartLocationDatabase_V3_Jan_2021_Final.csv) was gathered by EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency), which summarizes more than 90 different indicators associated with the built environment and location efficiency.Most attributes are available for all U.S. block groups.\nEPA first released a beta version of the Smart Location Database in 2011. The initial full version was released in 2013, and the database was updated to its current version in 2021.\nThe format of the data is geometry data based on census block groups. We plan to select the features that can best describe our research question, and select the data falls into Manhatten area in New York city. We plan to plot the density distribution of the data to examine the usability of the features for future use.",

In the plot_missing() function, when no missing values are present, the graph defaults to an x-axis scale ranging from -0.05 to 0.05. A similar case is demonstrated in the official reference: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataExplorer/vignettes/dataexplorer-intro.html\n\n\nCode\n#install.packages(\"naniar\")\n\nvis_miss(man_miss)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also use heatmap for missing value by packages(“naniar”), from the observations, 100% present of data are exsited. 0% percent value is missing.\n\n\nCode\naggr(man_data, col = c('navyblue', 'red'), numbers = TRUE, sortVars = FALSE, \n     labels = names(man_data), cex.axis = 0.7, gap = 3, \n     main = \"Missing Data Overview\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no missing data because proportion of missings is 0. If the combination count is 1 in the output of the aggr() function, it means there is only one distinct pattern of missingness across all the variables in the dataset. In other words:Every row with missing values has missingness in the exact same set of variables.No other unique missing value patterns exist in the dataset.",
